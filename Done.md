<p> Our definition of done is when we have a working website that can run with a few to no bugs and 
 has implemented the following features </p>
 
 1. An intuitive navigation bar which allows users to easily access the main features of the web
 2. A fleshed out game DB with a GUI for admins to easily perfrom CRUD operations.
 3. An informative game page for each game in the DB which contains detailed information about the game.
 4. A search system where users can find games based on a plethora of attributes such as title,genre,price,rating,release date
 5. A user profile which contains information about the user, a list of games he has liked/reviewed and posts he has made on the
     discussion board
 6. A way to allow certain users to be "verified" as game developers which give them to request admins
 7. A discussion board where admins can make topics or new categories and users can make posts
