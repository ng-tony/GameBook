PRINCIPLES
----------

### Overview
1. Intuitive, easy to navigate UI
2. Instant and simple coding
3. Unified repository
4. Useful for educational and presentation purposes

### Details
1. The spacious coding environment with an easy to navigate UI is preferred over
	unnecessary features and information that cluster the interface and confuse
	entry level users.

2. All users must have a way to instantly begin coding without any required configuration.

3. The application (for registered users) has a way to allow them to access files
	from any computer with internet, providing a repository that can be accessed
	from anywhere. This is preferred over offline but local access.

4. The application's simple interface and sharing capabilities benefits presentation and
	education usages. This is preferred over a more technical and customizable interface.
