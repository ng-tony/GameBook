OBJECTIVES
----------

###Overview
1. Setup account management and (restricted) guest access
2. Allow users to compile and run Python code
  - Access to save / load files with an account
3. UI to manage files, navigate site, and work on code

###Details
1. We need to develop an account management system for our main users who will have access to
	the core functionality of running and compiling code as well as the extended features
	of saving, loading and sharing files. The guest access is an immediate one click entry
	to the coding environment without any of the extended features.

2. We need to create a coding environment that can quickly run and compile code with
	access to core python libraries.

3. We need to develop an intuitive user-interface that allows the user to easily
	navigate the website, manage their files (registered users) and work on code in an
	environment that is not intimidating and distraction free.

KEY USERS
---------

###Overview
1. Entry level programmer
2. Computer Science / Programming-related student
3. Teacher's Assistant / Professors
4. Professionals

###Details
1. The entry level programmer is meant to describe every type of user that has zero or
	very limited amount of coding experience. That is, perhaps a younger audience who
	is being introduced to coding or perhaps someone interested in a career change.

2. The programming-related student can describe anyone in the CS department here at UTM.
 	This user may be interested in saving drafts of experimental code and furthermore, 
 	having the option to share that code with team mates and such.

3. This user is any sort of high-school / University instructor who wants to perhaps,
	have a snippet of code accessible to students or would like to demonstrate a
	certain concept to the class.

4. Professionals encompass anyone who is working in the field of I.T. or similar
	and would appreciate an easy, distraction free environment to use as a test bench,
	that they can have have access to from multiple computers.

SCENARIOS
---------

###Overview
1. User wanting to learn / practice code
2. User wanting to experiment / work on code with convenience
3. User wanting to demo / present code

###Details
1. Lisa is intrigued by programming when her older brother shows her some things he has been
	working on. She goes online to learn more but is overwhelmed by a sea of suggestions on
	what IDE to download and how to configure them. This user needs an easier way to test the
	waters with coding.

2. Jason was in the middle of eating cereal for breakfast when he comes up with 
	an idea to solve a problem he was working on yesterday. He needs a way to quickly 
	experiment with the idea he has come up with.

3. Michael works at a tutoring institute where he is responsible for progressively teaching
	students different programming concepts. The facility has multiple rooms with different
	independent computers. This user needs a way to have a repository of template code
	that he can access from any computer.

PRINCIPLES
----------

###Overview
1. Intuitive, easy to navigate UI
2. Instant and simple coding
3. Unified repository
4. Useful for educational and presentation purposes

###Details
1. The spacious coding environment with an easy to navigate UI is preferred over
	unnecessary features and information that cluster the interface and confuse
	entry level users.

2. All users must have a way to instantly begin coding without any required configuration.

3. The application (for registered users) has a way to allow them to access files
	from any computer with internet, providing a repository that can be accessed
	from anywhere. This is preferred over offline but local access.

4. The application's simple interface and sharing capabilities benefits presentation and
	education usages. This is preferred over a more technical and customizable interface.
