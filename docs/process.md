# Team Organization and Formation
- Our group was formed since we all had the same tutorial and sat next to each other
- We communicated through group chat and voice chat using discord and also by creating issues on github
  ## We divided the roles as such 
    - Christoph: writing the "gamer" persona 
    - Shuyi: summary and definition of done
    - Tony: formalizing,formatting  and creating the UI we agreed upon in our meeting, also writing the "web developer" persona
    - Martin: competition research and how our product differs from our competition
    - Harman: writing the "Adminstrator" persona
    - Everyone: writing user stories

# User Stories 

- Brainstormed user stories in our last meeting and recorded it 
- of the stories generated, we chose the most important ones to put in our product backlog
- from there we came up with a prioritization system based on the 
  number of stories we collected. It took generally 2 rounds of voting to come to a consensus. We decided to score our time estimation based on hours
- For estimation, our group got in voice chat and for each story we first let everyone pick their priority for the story then 
  we took a rough average based on everyone opinions. The same method was used for time estimate
  
# Decision Making

   - As a team we quickly decided that a web app was the easiest project to do so we chose this as our project
   - We had a hard time deciding what our site would be and we spent a week coming up with ideas and then choosing one
   - After a week, we had two ideas: A online scheduling or task managing app, A game information/social networking site 
      (goodreads for gamers). 
   - In the end we decided to go with the game site as we agreed that it would be easier to implement as the backend logic 
    would be much simpler.

    
 # Meetings 
 - In total we had 3 meetings each one was after the tutorial 
   
     ## Meeting 1:
      - introduction and exchanging of contact information
      - getting a rough idea of what we plan to do
      - after the meeting nothing relating to the project was done
      
     ## Meeting 2:
      - Agreed that an webapp was the way to go
      - 2 web app ideas were proposed a online scheduling or task managing app, a game information/social networking site
      - Couldn't agree which idea to use
      
     ## Meeting 3:
      - Agreed that the game site was our project
      - Found the main objective and identified key users of our site
      - Brainstormed user stories/features we want to add based on our objective and key users
      - Based on user stories, we came up with a rough version of our UI which we drew on the board as reference
        to create a better formatted one online. 
      
# Next Phase
  <p> The biggest issue we found was communication, It was rather evident early on that it was hard to get everyone together
  at the same time. Thus, our only meetings as a group were done in person after tutorial as that was when we could always
  get everyone together. Also due to the difficulty in collabaration we split our work in a way so that minimal interaction was required. 
  Overall, the the biggest lesson learned through this phase is that getting everyone together is extremely difficult and we need
  to find a way to make sure everyone is always on the same page.
