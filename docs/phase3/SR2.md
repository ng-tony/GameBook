# Unfinished tasks:

All planned tasks were finished to completion

# Meeting Overview:

In the retrospective, the GameBook team reflected on the progress of our project and thought of ways to improve our productivity. All memebers were present for this meeting.

## Goods

The team had accomplished the majority of the task that were aimed for in this sprint. The most of the important intended features are created and functional to a degree. Frontend code and backend code have been somewhat integrated and there are results to be shown for it. Work was split evenly and members worked together to inherit each other's skill and to get work complete.

## Bads

We started the sprint a bit later than we should have, having our first meeting in the middle of the sprint whereas we should have done it at the start. While our communication did improve we found ourselves in scenarios where we often did not understand what each team mate did.

## Improvement

Our use of tools can still be further improved upon. We have not completly integrated the Pivotal tracker into our work flow and so, tracking was not the greatest. Tasks were made and checked off as an after thought rather than as a guideline for developement.

We should try to create documentation for our code, even in-line will prove beneficial to help others understand what their work is supposed to do. Previously we had just relied upon function/variable names, however this proves to be troublesome when trying to debug somebody else's code. Additionally we should work to create test cases to make sure that any further changes do not break our current implemented features.

# Meeting Conclusion

The meeting was productive and we garnered a lot of ideas about the direction of our project. We noted our good points, our mistakes and thought of ideas to remdy the former and accentuate the latter.
