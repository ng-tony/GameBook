# Unfinished tasks:

- User Profile

These tasks are accurately represented as our existing user story in our phase 3 PB and PivotalTracker.

# Meeting Overview:

In the retrospective, the GameBook team reflected on the progress of our project and thought of ways o improve. All memebers were present for this meeting.

##Goods

The team had accomplished the majority of the task that were aimed for in this sprint. The core of the codebase seems to be set in place. Frontend code and backend code have been somewhat integrated and there are results to be shown for it. Work was split evenly and members worked together to inherit each other's skill and to get work complete.

##Bads

We realized that we had allocated too much work for ourselves in this sprint. We were unable to complete our sprint goals, and had left one task basically untouched. Time management was also a detriment, while we got a lot of work completed, a lot of our work was completed near the end of the sprint. One of the contributing reasons was lack of communication, where members in the team did not ask for help when they were stuck.

##Improvement

We believed that it would be great for our team to communicate more clearly and openly about our current work in order to make better use of the resources that we have. We also decided that our use of Git and Pivotal Tracker was limited and could be greatly increased. For example branches were not used too well and lot's of commits were placed into the master branch directly. Pivotal tracker and it's tracking tags were unused because team members found the tool unfamiliar and often forgot to do so.

Since many of us were unfamiliar with the technologies that we had decided to use in this project, naturally there was a large learning curve, and as we progress through the project we expect for our knowledge to improve and for trivial problems to become nonexistant. In the meantime communication is important so we can take the expertise of one member to solve problems that less experience members encounter.

We decided that it was benificial to compartmentalize our stories into smaller tasks in the beginning of our sprint, which will help alleviate communication issues and it allows for an easier guidelines to follow, to prevent the feeling of overwhelmingness.

# Meeting Conclusion

The meeting was productive and we garnered a lot of ideas about the direction of our project. We noted our good points, our mistakes and thought of ideas to remdy the former and accentuate the latter.
