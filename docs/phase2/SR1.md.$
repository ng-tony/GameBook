# Unfinished tasks:

- User Profile

These tasks are accurately represented as our existing user story in our phase 3 PB and PivotalTracker.

# Meeting Overview:

In the retrospective, the GameBook team reflected on the progress of our project and thought of ways o improve. All memebers were present for this meeting.

##Goods

The team had accomplished the majority of the task that were aimed for in this sprint. The core of the codebase seems to be set in place. Frontend code and backend code have been somewhat integrated and there are results to be shown for it. Work was split evenly and members worked together to inherit each other's skill and to get work complete.

##Bads

We realized that we had allocated too much work for ourselves in this sprint. We were unable to complete our sprint goals, and had left one task basically untouched. 
##Improvement

We found that 

Initially, the team adjusted the product backlog to match their evolving vision of GRACE REPL's codebase. Providing account login and register functionalities- tasks we had hoped to complete in sprint 1- were largely unfinished. As such, the user story regarding these features remains as it was before in our product backlog. However, in sprint 1 our team devised new ideas for design (such as our CRC implementation) upon exposure to technology new to the team like the MEAN stack, and the compilex library. As an example, we discovered that implementing code sharing would likely be more difficult than we had planned due to our planned DAO CRC design, and we increased the size of the accompanying user story 
accordingly.

As a result, the product backlog received an overhaul. Though user story content did not change, their size and importance were reworked to accommodate our new vision for the code's structure. All revised rankings were reached through group consensus at the meeting.

Our aforementioned CRC model employs the DAO design pattern. Because of our experiences in sprint 1, we realized how querying MongoDB would interface with Object Oriented design; the group unanimously agreed upon this revision to our CRC design in light of this.

In our reflection, we identified several strengths of our developmental approach which we agreed to continue. These include:
- Staying in our designated subgroups for completing tasks
- Employ pair programming within subgroups
- Keeping consistent communication while coding with the entire team
- Ensuring every team member shares the same coding environment
- Holding regular verification demos upon milestones
- Ensuring product maintains a consistent vision

Our approach to sprint 1 was not without weakness, and we agreed to implement practices to circumvent these issues. For example, to gain a better visualisation of our code, we agreed to divide our user stories into concrete, micro-scale tasks beforehand. Furthermore, we wanted to employ regular code completion. Rather than allowing work to accumulate towards the end of the sprint, we will ensure that work is completed on digestible time intervals.

Indeed, the major practice that we agreed to eliminate was the buildup of tasks as well. The group reached a unanimous decision not to leave work towards the end of the sprint cycle and instead break up the bulk of it across the entire timeframe. 

Some of the group's worst experiences stemmed from the aforementioned task buildup. In consequence, most of our team were unable to sleep prior to classes the day after the sprint. The other chief reason for our work experiences was the adaptation to new technology. The subgroup working on the account management user story was unable to implement MongoDB in time, and as such our user story implementation
was not finished in time for sprint 1.

Conversely, our best experiences included the completion of the compiler- seeing the working results was obviously satisfying for all involved. The design document, notably the system architecture diagram was very helpful in understanding the technologies available to us and how they interact. Finally, finishing our initial CRC model provided us one of our best experiences in sprint 1 as well. After that was designed, our group envisioned our code base with a much greater clarity than before, and it was a fun experience coding with it on hand. 

# Meeting Conclusion:

GRACE's first SCRUM meeting was a successful gathering where our team members were able to find our bearings again. We noted our past mistakes and attempted to ensure we would not repeat them in the future.
